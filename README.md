# Tea Taster

- clone the repo
- `cd test-drake-api`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`
- `npm run build`
- `npx cap open android`
- `npx cap open ios`

As noted, the Mobile Min Version is displayed in web (`npm start`) and on iOS but provides an "unknown error"
when run on Android.

The rest of the app, however, works fine with the "Tea Taster" API.

My best guess without digging further is that there is something amiss with the "Drake" API itself.
